# DungeonOfGechoes
A text-based adventure game designed to teach Python functions, dictionaries, lists, and other basic concepts.

The Dungeon of (G)Echoes is a simple text-based adventure game that I put together to help me teach some concepts to the GECO Girls club that I   volunteer for!

The idea was to show them how to start creating a more modular game where functions do the work and automate some of the gameplay. 

I added a few features:
- Custom name and weapon input
- Hit point and loot counters
- randomly chosen enemies
- randomly chosen room descriptions
- combat function

I am always happy to receive feedback, so feel free to share!
